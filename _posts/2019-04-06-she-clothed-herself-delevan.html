	Biiiiiig shoutout to the homie on this one, Aleeshuh My Urchin, for the mad hookups in southern Wisconsin. We  couldn't possbly have planned for our midway stop to go any better than it did. John and Marsha are the most delightful midwesterners and their quaint lakehouse was a 5 star experience especially because we got to hang with Roxy, their 4 year old petite labradoodle, (<i>see photo to melt your heart ;)</i>). From the moment we arrived to the moment we left I couldn't help but continually quote my brother, "This is a GREAT SPOT", "Dang, this worked out well!" Marsha made us dinner and breakfast and set us up with ajoinng guest rooms. The highlight for me was sitting around the fire place talking and having homemade cookies. We also enjoyed walking out to the lake to see a beautiful inlit, which is actually where Leesh's parents got married!! Crazy! Sometimes I think that life moves too fast but it's times like these that really make you think, "Man this might really be what the time of it all is really all about." I look forward to my return to Delavan, WI and know that it will always hold a special place in my heart. <br/>

	We are now on the way to Minneapolis, the eden of basketball, and spirits are high, although my nerves are mounting within (see Dan's earlier article on prepositions). Can't wait to see everyone in MN, including my boi Deandre Hunter, go get 'em Dre. If you're still reading this, I'm proud of you for not just assuming I would stay in the 1st and 3rd person. You're truly who this blog is for and I would love to talk to you about future projects, please call my agent, Trenton, to set something up. Go Hoos!
