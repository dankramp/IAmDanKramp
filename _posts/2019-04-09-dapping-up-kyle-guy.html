	In the wake of leading his team the Virginia Wahoos to victory in the NCAA Championship game against Texas Tech, scoring 24 points against the enemy, and being named the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player, Kyle Guy demonstrates a profound humility when he stops to dap ME up out of everybody. I knew we were boys, but I had no idea it ran so deep. It was an incredible experience for me. I hope you are encouraged to reach for your goals no matter what anybody says, because if you <i>believe</i>, you can achieve literally anything. There is no ceiling to what you can accomplish.
