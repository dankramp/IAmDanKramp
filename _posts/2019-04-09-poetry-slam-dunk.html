	Red raiders were hardly a match. <br />
	Never had I seen an uglier batch. <br />
	Except for duke<br />
	Which looked like puke<br />
	And the Tigers couldn’t even scratch. <br />
	<br />
	Through the adventures along the way,<br />
	We made memories each and everyday<br />
	Though we’ve left Minnesota<br />
	And we’ve quit using “dontcha,”<br />
	There’s something important I’d like to say:<br />
	<br />
	Unless you’re with Bennett, king of the hoos,<br />
	Come March, you’ll surely be singing the blues.<br />
	The cavs are tough to beat,<br />
	So stick to the edge of your seat<br />
	Because there’s nobody you’d rather choose.<br />
