	Are prepositions an appropriate thing to end a sentence with? In our car today, this is one of the big questions we were talking about. We realized that it doesn't necessarily always sound grammatically correct, but it really does matter whom you're talking to. The conversation was short-lived however, as we were all growing in anticipation because of what the whole trip has been for. Tomorrow night, the Hoos are going to demolish Auburn, the opposing team they are taking on. We wanted to write this so that later we could all have something to laugh at. Unfortunately, we didn't come to a final conclusion on the matter, so in the future it seems this will be a conversation we will surely come back to.
