	Procrastinating <br />
	I am procrastinating.<br />
	I have work to do.<br />
	<br />
	Should type my paper<br />
	But I really don’t want to.<br />
	This is much more fun.<br />
	<br />
	I’m clapping 5 times.<br />
	Then I’m clapping 7 times.<br />
	And now back to 5.<br />
	<br />
	Look out the window.<br />
	There are a bunch of crop fields.<br />
	Flat Indiana.<br />
	<br />
	Should I do my work?<br />
	That would be idiotic.<br />
	Papers are awful.<br />
	<br />
	Carter, Rob, and Dan<br />
	They are with me in the car.<br />
	Long ride but still fun.<br />
	<br />
	Now I see windmills.<br />
	Wow. Just a massive wind farm.<br />
	Stay sustainable.<br />
	<br />
	That is all for now.<br />
	Thanks for reading these haikus.<br />
	Procrastinating<br />
