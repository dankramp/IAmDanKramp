		The road before us stretched along for miles<br />
		With nothing hidden yet nothing to see<br />
		Our spirits carry us to where we'll be<br />
		Surrounded by a thousand eager smiles<br />
		<br />
		The fields roll by beside, in front, behind<br />
		Becoming formless blurs before our eyes<br />
		These restless, spoiled souls crave some surprise<br />
		Yet hours pass with no new thoughts in mind. <br />
		<br />
		The promised land lies just within our reach,<br />
		the fruits of labor come only by sweat<br />
		so we pursue, Purdue twice in our past. <br />
		We've learned all that this desert has to teach,<br />
		Preparing, pruning, proving - no regret.<br />
		We come upon the Final Four at last. <br />
