					<div class="card-text" style="font-size: 1.2em;">
						Four teams, one city. Four Hoos, one car. Reality is sometimes like a poem that writes itself, isn't it? From the racous college town of Charlottesville, Virginia, across the desolate plains of Illinois, and finally on to Minneapolis, Minnesota, follow us as we document our experience of avoiding pressing responsibilities back home to support our Cavaliers in the Final Four. In this blog, you'll find brief narratives about sights we see or places we go, as well as mixed forms of media such as poetry, imagery, and satirical pieces. We do not intend to accomplish anything through this blog, nor record anything of particular significance. Rather, it simply exists to provide light entertainment for ourselves and for our fans. We will not put substantial emphasis on correcting grammar or spelling errors but rather in delivering medium-quality content for the world to see and soon forget. The hope that we cling to is not that of aspiring writers. <br /> <br />Join us on our roadtrip to the Final Four where we will surely see the Virinia Cavaliers take the title. <br /><br />

										<div class="card-title">Carter Berry</div>
										<div class="card-text">From mastering the Masters, to having the final word on the Final Four, Carter is the point man on all things sports. His writing style will keep you curiously distant, like watching a car accident. In his free time, Carter likes to create spreadsheets in Excel and his favorite meal is macaroni and cheese with hot dogs.

										<div class="card-title">Dan Kramp</div>
										<div class="card-text">Just west of Philadelphia, born and raised, Daniel B. Kramp is a gritty hustler from the streets. He offers all what lies behind the machine learning of this literary venture. Count on a fair share of poetry, prose, and a point of view unique to a fiercely committed Cavalier fan. In the off-season and during his downtime, Dan plays super smash brothers melee and pretends that cars may someday drive themselves.

										<div class="card-text">This is Robert's placeholder bio. He is a cool fellow. This will be filled out with actual text once one of us actually decides to write it. Until that time, it will only contain the information I have just now written here. I hope that's enough for you!

										<div class="card-title">Trenton Burmeister</div>
										<div class="card-text">If you're looking for the <i>bandit</i> of your heart, look no further than Trenton. He's the glue to our trip and is always willing to sacrifice himself for others. He loves Indianapolis, a good laugh, and reminding people of his Midwest roots in Kenosha, WI. He will surely move you with his emotional and passionate writing that he's most likely learned from being a Curry School Biology major.
